# Employee Management App

#### By Jeremy Moudy

#### A basic employee management system. 

## Technologies Used
- Java Servlets 
- JSPs
- MySQL

## Description
This project was used to learn and practice back-end web development using regular servlets and JSPs, before 
diving into SpringBoot. The front-end is very basic, since designing the webpages was not the primary focus 
of this project. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Clone the repo to your computer
- Run `mvn install` to get the required dependencies
- Launch the Tomcat server and navigate to <localhost:8080>

## Known Bugs
- Still need to add input validation to the fields to protect against entering an `int` as the name, etc.
- Need to add protections against trying to remove/edit an employee who is not in the database.
